    <h3>Test application
        <small>This application is written in Grails 3.2.3, using a bootstrap distribution to style the pages</small>
    </h3>
    <p>
        I use a CSS based on a licensed copy the theme Angle, that you can find in wrapbootstrap.com. Buy a copy of the theme if you want to use it on the app.
